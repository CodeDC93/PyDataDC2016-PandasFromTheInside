# Pandas from the Inside

Tutorial session from PyData Washington DC, Friday 7 October 2016.

**_Note!_ Check back early morning on Fri 7 October for the final version**

If you want to follow along the examples on your own laptop, please 
have the latest versions of Python3, Pandas and IPython installed.
If you don't have Python already, the easiest route is via the
full Anaconda Python distribution (300MB). Details are at
http://conda.pydata.org/docs/installation.html.


The main files are:

* `pfi.pdf` and `pfi.pptx`- Presentation slides. As some slides are quite detailed,
you may want to download these to follow along on your own laptop/tablet.

* `Pandas from the Inside (PyData DC).ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with code from the 
slides plus some further explanation. Download this if you have Jupyter 
installed on your laptop. Otherwise you can view the rendered notebook 
here on GitHub.

* `pfi.py` - An earlier version of the code in the Jupyter notebook. This may be useful
if you don't have Jupyter installed.

* `bg3.txt` - Sample data file from http://afltables.com/afl/stats/biglists/bg3.txt. 
A copy is included in this repo for your convenience.
